##I looked at someone else's code and was inspired to try it out myself. Being able to control what drum is playing is exciting
##and I also realized that you could add more of a melody and have complete control over what plays. 

soft = :drum_bass_soft
hard = :drum_bass_hard

define :drum_1 do
  3.times do
    beats = (ring soft, hard, hard, soft, hard, hard)
    sleep 0.5
  end
end

define :drum_2 do
  5.times do
    beats = (ring hard, soft, hard, soft)
    sleep 0.25
  end
end

define :drum_3 do
  9.times do
    beats = (ring soft, soft, soft, hard, hard)
    sleep 0.5
  end
end

live_loop :control do
  controller = 3
  drum_1 if controller == 1
  drum_2 if controller == 2
  drum_3 if controller == 3
end
