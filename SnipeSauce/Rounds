#Project 3: Rounds
#In the script below we took the popular round, Canon, and wrote it in D major. Canon is a popular round
#in that everyone has heard and is most commonly played during graduations or weddings. It is a piece
#that was composed by Johahn Pachelbel. It is said that the piece was written in 1694 for the wedding of
#Johan Cristoph Bach. In a round, we approached the concept of multiple voices layered over each other with
#each voice starting at a different section. So, we wrote a script that exhibits this using syncing and cueing
#commands to bring in a new voice with its own set of notes and unique sound.

use_bpm 120

#We start with the “main” section that carries through the entirety of the piece as the crux and as somewhat
#of the bass as well. We chose to use 120bpm so that writing the arpeggio would be easier math. That is, we
#will be adding several 1s which serve as quarter notes, each which line up to one bass note of 4 beats.
#Since the tempo is at 120, we have the main playing solo for 8 full measures, then we cue in the next layer/voice
#which is simply the arpeggio of the main line.

#The next voice starts on measure 9 of the whole piece and carries on for the remainder of the piece. It plays
