# I figured out which notes I needed for the baseline and they play in the correct order
# once you run the program. I am still trying to figure out how to sustain certain notes
# in bass line so that it doesnt sound as choppy. Also need to add a drum sequence to
# accompany the base line.

# I tinkered with the sleeps to make it sound a bit more like the original,
# but I couldn't figure out the sustains! Sorry that I messed with the code a bit!
# Also, I added a kick drum.
