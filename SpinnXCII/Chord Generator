##took inspiration from the warmup from class on october 5 to practice using calling
##got the chord progression from the chord generator and tried to mimic the drums they put in the background 

use_bpm 74

chord_prog = [chord(:d4, :minor),
              chord(:c4, :major),
              chord(:f3, :major),
              chord(:d4, :minor)
              ]

calling = (ring 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2)

in_thread do
  use_synth :blade
  live_loop :chords do
    tick
    play chord_prog[calling.look]
    sleep 1
  end
end


live_loop :drums do
  tick
  rest = 0
  drums = (ring 1, rest, 2, rest)
  if drums.look == 1
    sample :drum_bass_soft
  end
  if drums.look ==2
    sample :drum_cymbal_closed
  end
  sleep 0.5
end
