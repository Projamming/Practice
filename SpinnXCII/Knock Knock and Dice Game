## Extra non-music practice 10/23

## In this knock knock game, there is one joke but the comp comes up with a randomized witty reply at the end 

def knock
  puts "Knock knock"
  answer = gets.chomp 
  puts "Orange"
  answer = gets.chomp
  puts "Orange you glad I didn't say banana"
  answer = gets.chomp

  puts "now it's you turn, type: knock knock" 
  answer = gets.chomp 

  options = ["I'm just kidding, a computer can't understand jokes","nevermind, let's leave off on a high note"]
  comp_choice = options.sample 

  puts comp_choice 
end 


## In this knock knock game, the computer has two options of jokes it could tell you 

def kk
  puts "knock knock"
  answer = gets.chomp

  options1 = ["orange", "cow says"]
  comp_choice1 = options1.sample 

  puts comp_choice1
  answer = gets.chomp 

  if comp_choice1 == "orange"
    puts "orange you glad I didn't say banana"
  elsif comp_choice1 == "cow says"
    puts "no, cow says MOOOO"
  end 
end 
 
## This dice game, much like flipping a coin, involves the human guessing and the computer rolling 
## The computer lets you know if you were right or wrong
