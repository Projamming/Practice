Practice with clojure 

;; class code: 
;;(for [i (range 10)] (* i 2))
;; my version 
(for [i (range 4 12)] (* i 2))
;; I tried to do a range between 4 and 12 and then the second half of the 
list be muliplied by 2 but didnt work --> (8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22) 
;; i think it's multiplying the different numbers in the range by 2
(range 4 12) ;; this has the range correct, but can't get to go like class code 

(def bananas '(1 2 3 4 5 6))
(* bananas[1] bananas[4]) ;; would it be possible to muliply 
within the list using indexes calling the numbers from bananas' list? Did not work
