def nikes
  play :e2, duration: 4
  play :c2, duration: 4
end

def nikes2
  play :e4, duration: 2.0

  play :g4, duration: 6.0
  play :b5, duration: 6.0
  sleep 1

def nikes4

##How do I get nikes to play for the whole time that nikes 2 and 3 play? They need to overlap
##because nikes is the base sound held and then nikes3 and nikes4 play on top of it
