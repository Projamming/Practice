# Predict the output before you run the code. Then check!
## the code plays a note and then the corresponding chord three times and repeats this process twice
# Next, what would you have to change about the code so that the three notes
# play, then the three chords play, and so on, alternating forever? Try to
# change as few lines as possible.
## add a new 3.times do with the chords and then make the 2.times do a loop instead
