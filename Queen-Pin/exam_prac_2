# Predict the output before you run the code. Then check!

# What would you have to change about the code so that the two
# harmony rings alternate as the melody plays?
## add play_pattern_timed harmony_ring_2, duration ring under line 26
# How could we bring harmony_ring_2 in to join both melody_ring
# and harmony_ring_1 at the moment when melody_ring is beginning
# its third playthrough?
## create another thread and loop with sleep 8 and then cue harmony_2 or something
# Finally, what must we do so that one of the two harmony_rings
# is chosen at random each time the melody_ring restarts?
## create a list of harmony rings and have sonic pi randomly choose
