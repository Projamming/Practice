;; I decided to write a function that will reverse the letters in a word and then reverse 
;; the order of those words in a list.
;; I don't think we were formally taught the reverse function, but I decided to type in reverse
;; and see what happened...luckily it does what it calls for!:)

;; (defn reversal
;;   "Outputs word1 in reverse."
;;   [word1]
;;   (apply str (reverse word1))  ;; If I don't apply str, then I get: (\t \a \c).
;; )

;; (defn backwards
;;   "Outputs a list of reverse words in reverse."
;;   [lst1]
;;   (reverse (map reversal lst1))  ;; Applies the function, reversal, to each word in the list,
                                    ;; then reverses the order of the list.
;; )
