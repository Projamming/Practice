# Written in class on Thursday, September 13.
# We took the code for the Marinera rhythm (see below), which was
# written in sample/sleep format, and compressed it into a couple
# of rings. To simplify the rings, we also defined two variables:

tom =  :drum_tom_hi_hard
bass = :drum_bass_hard

define :rhythm do
  
  7.times do
  
    tick :drums_clock
    
    drums = (ring tom, bass, tom, bass, tom, bass, tom)
    drums_sleep = (ring 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
    drums_amps = (ring 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1)
    
    sample drums.look, amp: drums_amps.look
    sleep drums_sleep.look
  end
  
end

loop do
  
  bpm_ring = (ring 60, 80, 100, 120)
  use_bpm bpm_ring.tick(:bpm_clock)
  ##| print bpm_ring.look
  
  rhythm
  
end

# Unfortunately, it doesn't work! It played the tom 7
# times at each different tempo, which is something,
# but it completely negated the bass drum! Interesting...
  
7.times do
  use_bpm 60
  rhythm
end


7.times do
  use_bpm 80
  rhythm
end


7.times do
  use_bpm 100
  rhythm
end


21.times do
  use_bpm 120
  rhythm
end
